# Why

This project was developed for the busy individual who feels that they have little-to-no time to get in better shape. As developers, we know how working at a computer all day can cause many physical ailments, such as poor posture, limited mobility, and diminished overall health. We built this app because we know that our health, both physical and mental, is the key to our success.
